there are lots of cryptography algorithms, many are considered
compromised, also some of the utilities such as random number
generators around cryptography are compromised

-- Bad Ones --
- RSA: NSA worked with this company and paid for a backdoor
       to their random number generator
- DES: this was worked on with NSA and faulty, outdated
- NIST: this has up-my-sleeve numbers


-- Ok --
- AES: this seems to be a standard, used by Apple and such,
       but how it is implemented matters: the random number
       generator is important. Also improtantly it uses
       large prime numbers to generate keys. Since there
       are relatively few large primes, it is prone to
       brute force attacks (doubt anyone would)
- secp256k1: bitcoin uses this


-- Good? --

- EdDSA and Ed25519
edwards curve digital signature algorithm, uses eliptic curves
such as Curve25519 (255bit) and Curve448-Goldilocks are good examples
of this and apparently are formed with no strange "up-my-sleeve"
numbers.
- many listed on SafeCurves.
