Analog Inputs and Outputs on ESP32
friday - 7th
-----------------------------------------------------------

=== Analog Output ===
there are two pins on the esp32 that support digital to
analog conversion (DAC): GPIO 25 and GPIO 26. There are a few
modes of outputting to these channels. Note that these notes
are on the new version of DAC.

--Include Files--
dac_oneshot.h shold be included when oneshots are used.
dac_cosine.h should be used to output cosine.
dac_conti.h should be used for continous output.

--Oneshot Mode--
this mode allows you to directly set the output voltage
relative to the input voltage into your board. The value,
sent using dac_oneshot_output_voltage(), takes a uint8
value, allowing for 255 levels of voltage output.

--Continuous Wave Mode--
this is usefull for stuff like audio. there are a few ways
to use this mode. synchronous, cyclical, and asynchronous.
there are several frequencies of output that can work here
19.6KHz - several MHz.

--Cosine Wave Mode--
you can output a cosine wave, specifying the amplitude,
phase, and frequency.

=== Analog Input ===
there are two units capable of reading analog input.

--Oneshot Mode--
