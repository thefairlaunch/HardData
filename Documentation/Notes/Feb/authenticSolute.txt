Authenticating Solute Nodes
tuesday - 24th
-----------------------------------------------------------

Solute Nodes and their messages must be authenticated and
have the option to be encrypted.

-- Authenticating Messages --
Messages should be authenticated by signature.

-- Encrypting Messages --
Messages can be encrypted via public key of receiver.

--- Private Groups on the Network ---
Consider a group of nodes on solvent that trust eachother.
The group may want to send messages across the network to
one another without the network seeing the messages.
A group could use a group identifier, where everyone knows
both public and private key.

--- Solute Groups ---
Groups form when a node invites another node to join its group.
The invitation has the ID of the invitor, and invitee, as well
as the group identifier. The message is signed by the invitor.
Groups are trusted nodes, who share private key allowing
the group to communicate with encryption.
Getting a groups private key to the invitee, requires first the
invitee to respond with a signed acceptance, next the invitor
will encrypt the message using the invitees public encryption key
and send it to the invitee, now messages can be sent to the entire
group without needing to encrypt for each individual in the group,
saving compute.
