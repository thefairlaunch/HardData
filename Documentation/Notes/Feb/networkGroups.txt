Network Groups
wednesday - 26th
-----------------------------------------------------------

-- What would a Group Be? --
multiple nodes that trust eachother and want to communicate
groups may differ if they want each node to keep track of
who is in the group or not.

-- Possible Private Group Communications --
a group could simply share a single symmetric key, the downside
being if a node becomes untrusted the group must change keys.
[no persistent tracking of members list]

a group could work by having members generate a new symmetric
key with each send, and asymetric encrypt that key for each
of the receivers so a member chooses who can decrypt
[requires tracking of members list]

a group could act together to find out the key, using something
like Shamir's Secret Sharing Algorihtm
