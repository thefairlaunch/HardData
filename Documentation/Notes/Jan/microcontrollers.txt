--ESP32-- [https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf]
~$10
esp32-wroom-32 has 2.4 GHz wifi, bluetooth / ble, and dual
cores. about a megabyte of ram, and 32 pins.
18 ADC channels; 3 SPI pins; 3 UART pins; 16 PWM outputs
2 DAC channels; 2 i2S pins; 10 GPIOs

--ESP32-PICO-DevKitM-2--
~$12.00
has more memory then plain esp32 which makes it possible to
do both bluetooth and wifi at the same time according to
a review on amazon, although it may be possible on esp32.
+8 MB of flash + 2 MB PSRAM is great for $2

--ESP32-P4-Functino-EV-Board--
$56 on aliexpress
this might be useful for the Solvent boards, or even a beefy
version of a Solute. 400Mhz RISC-V prossesor 32 MB PSRAM, vector
multiplication. wifi 6 / ble .

--- Software of the ESP32 --- [https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32/index.html]
espressif produces the esp32 and has documentation on how to
program it. the boards use FreeRTOS as their operating system.
they provide an ESP-IDF and have a repo for their tooling on
compiling / flashing programs to their boards. https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf
pretty well documented and easy to set up on M1 macpro.
easy to use with vscode or zed, much better option than arduino.
the library is basically a esp specific version of freeRTOS.

---Other Micro Controllor Options---
Renesas RZ/N1D : 500 MHz + lots of peripherals + more memory + quad core potential
SiFi: way to big but RISC-V
Texas Instruments: some cool ones
none of these are as easy to set up.
