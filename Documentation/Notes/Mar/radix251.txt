--- Context ---
arithmetic on the edwards curve involves integers in a prime field
2^{255} - 19. these are essentially 256 bit numbers, but our
cpus only handle operations with 16, 32, 64 bit elements. this means
we must define addition, subtraction, multiplication, squaring
with 256 bit numbers, and must do it in an efficient way.

256 bit numbers can be represented in 4-limb radix 64, i.e 4 words of 64 bits
or it could be 8-limb 32 bit words, or 16-limb 16 bit words, ...
however implementing these leads to slowness due to carries /
overflows. therefore there is a standard in crytography to use a
5-limb 51bit representation (ed25519 is elements are equiv mod 2^{255}-19)
